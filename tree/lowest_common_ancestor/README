lowest common ancestor of 2 nodes in a tree, is a lowest node in a tree which is
an ancestor of both the nodes.

For example,

                                    3
                                   / \
                                  /   \
                                 6     8
                                /\      \
                               /  \      \
                              2    11     13
                                  / \     /
                                 /   \   /
                                9     5 7



In above example, the lowest common ancestor between [2, 5] is 6.
Please note that 3 is also a common ancestor for [2, 5], but its not lowest.

the lowest common ancestor between [3, 2] is 3.

the lowest common ancestor between [6, 7] is 3.



solution:

Node lca(Node root, Node n1, Node n2)
{
    if(root == NULL) return NULL;

    if( root == n1 || root == n2) 
        return root;

    left_node = lca(root->left, n1, n2);
    right_node = lca(root->right, n1, n2);
    
    if(left_node != NULL  && right_node != NULL) 
        return root;

    if(left_node == NULL && right_node == NULL)
        return NULL;

    return left_node != NULL  ? left_node : right_node;
}
